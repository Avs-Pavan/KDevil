# Devil
Real-time logger for Android <br>
Built up on Mqtt - primarily designed for low-speed networks.


# Debug - Error - Verbose - Info - Logger<br>
A project that demonstrates real-time logging in Android application. These logs can be monitored in 
a partner app called DevilBoard. This can really be useful while submitting the application for 
a tester/client. As we can see from the logs in real-time, the communication gap between the tester and 
developer can be decreased exponentially, which will decrease the development time. 
Also if something goes wrong while the tester is testing we have all the logs we need to debug the 
situation and pinpoint the cause of the issue then and there. We can use the same logs to identify 
bottlenecks in the API server and solve them efficiently. 
A Custom interceptor specially designed to work with retrofit to give accurate timestamps of 
request and response. The complete Devil logger will intercept all the network calls in the 
application with only 2 lines of code. 


# Pros<br>
Light weight<br>
Light speed<br>
Low data usage<br>
Can provide the details about log code location<br>
Intercepts all API calls in Android with 2 lines of code<br>
Rule-based - Local logs + Remote logs - each can be disabled and enabled individually<br>
Can monitor real-time user - online user count / offline user count<br>
Can give more data on API bottlenecks. <br>
Filtering out individual user logs in realtime<br>
Can be easily implemented for other platforms as well.<br>
